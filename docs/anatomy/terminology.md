# Terminology

## Parts of the Body

Donna is comprised of Senses, a Brain with Cortices, and Controls.
- Senses = anything going in
- Cortex = modular cognitive functions for processing information
- Controls = anything going out

### Senses

Senses are inputs, such as being able to see from a webcam
or hear from a microphone.

### Cortex

A Cortex is like a modular piece of the brain that is responsible for
processing a particular type of information.

### Controls

Outputs can be anything from Physical motion
(think robot with arms / legs / etc)
or sending a SMS message (texting) or even output this YouTube video to
the Chromecast on the TV.

The Controls expect a certain format, too. And the Cortex is responsible for any Encoding and Retrieving before transmitting in that valid format.

## Flow of Information

Sense receives stimulus and sends that input to the Brain as a Thought.
The Brain is comprised of many Cortices that process Thoughts.
Cortices have the ability to process a Thought and
consequentially output a response through Controls, and influence the world.
