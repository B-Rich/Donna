## About

Donna is a platform for developing an artificial intelligent, virtual secretary.
You can create your own instance of Donna and extend her with a wide variety of plugins. Plugins range from Senses to Cortices to Controls.

- `Senses` are responsible for receiving stimulus as inputs into Donna.
    - Audio from microphones, Visuals from cameras, textual messages from SMS (texting), and more.
- `Cortices` are modular pieces of her brain that allow Donna to process `Thoughts`.
    - Text to Intent (Wit.ai), Speech Recognition, Facial Recognition, and more.
- `Controls` are ways Donna can interact and output information or responses to the world.
    - Show content on Chromecast on the TV, send SMS (text) messages, move robot limbs, and more.

For more technical information see [the documentation](docs/).

### Features

- Extensible with plugins for Senses, Cortices, and Controls.
- Distributed over many devices: Mac, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi.

[Wit.ai](wit.ai) handles the Natural Language Processing and Donna takes care of interpretting the users' intent and interacting with the world.
